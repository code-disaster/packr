# packr

Packages your JAR, assets and a JVM for distribution on Windows (ZIP), Linux (ZIP) and Mac OS X (.app), adding a native executable file to make it appear like the app is a native app. Packr is most suitable for GUI applications, such as games made with [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)

#### [Download Packr](http://bit.ly/packrgdx)

## Usage
You point packr at your JAR file (containing all your code and assets), a JSON config file (specifying parameters to the JVM and the main class) and a URL or local file location to an OpenJDK build for the platform you want to build. Invoking packr from the command line may look like this:

```bash
java -jar packr.jar \
     -platform mac \
     -jdk "openjdk-1.7.0-u45-unofficial-icedtea-2.4.3-macosx-x86_64-image.zip" \
     -executable myapp \
     -icons myapp.icns \
     -appjar myapp.jar \
     -mainclass "com/my/app/MainClass" \
     -bundleIdentifier "com.my.app" \
     -vmargs "-Xmx1G" \
     -resources pom.xml;src/main/resources \
     -minimizejre "soft" \
     -outdir out
```

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| platform | one of "windows", "linux32", "linux64", "mac" |
| jdk | ZIP file location or URL to an OpenJDK build containing a JRE. Prebuild JDKs can be found at https://github.com/alexkasko/openjdk-unofficial-builds |
| executable | name of the native executable, without extension such as ".exe" |
| icons | (optional) file location of platform dependent icon resources |
| appjar | file location of the JAR to package |
| mainclass | the fully qualified name of the main class, using forward slashes to delimit package names |
| bundleIdentifier | (optional) application bundle identifier, e.g. "com.badlogicgames.packr" |
| vmargs | list of arguments for the JVM, separated by `;`, e.g. "-Xmx1G" |
| outdir | output directory |
| resources (optional) | list of files and directories to be packaged next to the native executable, separated by `;`.
| minimizejre | minimize the JRE by removing directories and files as specified by the config file. Comes with two config files out of the box called "soft" and "hard". See below for details on the minimization config file. |

Alternatively, you can put all the command line arguments into a JSON file which might look like this:

> my-packaging-config.json
```json
{
    "platform": "mac",
    "jdk": "/Users/badlogic/Downloads/openjdk-1.7.0-u45-unofficial-icedtea-2.4.3-macosx-x86_64-image.zip",
    "executable": "myapp",
    "icons": "myapp.icns",
    "appjar": "myapp.jar",
    "mainclass": "com/my/app/MainClass",
    "bundleIdentifier": "com.my.app",
    "vmargs": [
       "-Xmx1G"
    ],
    "resources": [
        "pom.xml",
        "src/main/resources"
    ],
    "minimizejre": "soft",
    "outdir": "out-mac"
}
```

You can then invoke the tool like this:

```bash
java -jar packr.jar my-packaging-config.json
```

Finally, you can use packr from within your code. Just add the JAR file to your project, either manually, or via the following Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.badlogicgames.packr</groupId>
   <artifactId>packr</artifactId>
   <version>1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

To invoke packr, you need to create an instance of `Config` and pass it to `Packr#pack()`

```java
Config config = new Config();
config.platform = Platform.windows;
config.jdk = "/User/badlogic/Downloads/openjdk-for-windows.zip";
config.executable = "myapp";
config.icons = "myapp.ico";
config.jar = "myjar.jar";
config.mainClass = "com/my/app/MainClass";
config.bundleIdentifier = "com.my.app";
config.vmArgs = Arrays.asList("-Xmx1G");
config.minimizeJre = new String[] { "jre/lib/rt/com/sun/corba", "jre/lib/rt/com/sun/jndi" };
config.outDir = "out-mac";

new Packr().pack(config)
```

## Minimization
A standard JRE weighs about 90mb unpacked and about 50mb packed. Packr helps you cut down on that size, thus also reducing the download size of your app. 

To minimize the JRE that is bundled with your app, you have to specify a minimization configuration file via the `minimizejre` flag you supply to Packr. Such a minimization configuration contains the names of files and directories within the JRE to be removed, one per line in the file. E.g.:

```
jre/lib/rhino.jar
jre/lib/rt/com/sun/corba 
````

This will remove the rhino.jar (about 1.1MB) and all the packages and classes in com.sun.corba from the rt.jar file. To specify files and packages to be removed from the JRE, simply prepend them with `jre/lib/rt/`.

Packr comes with two such configurations out of the box, [`soft`](https://github.com/libgdx/packr/blob/master/src/main/resources/minimize/soft) and [`hard`](https://github.com/libgdx/packr/blob/master/src/main/resources/minimize/hard)

Additionally, Packr will compress the rt.jar file. By default, the JRE uses zero-compression on the rt.jar file to make application startup a little faster.

## Output

When packing for Windows, the following folder structure will be generated

```
outdir/
   executable.exe
   yourjar.jar
   config.json
   jre/
```

Linux

```
outdir/
   executable
   yourjar.jar
   config.json
   jre/
```

Mac OS X

```
outdir/
   Contents/
      Info.plist
      MacOS/
         executable
         yourjar.jar
         config.json
         jre/
      Resources/
         icons.icns
```

You can further modify the Info.plist to your liking, e.g. manually add icons, a bundle identifier etc. If your `outdir` has the `.app` extension it will be treated as an application bundle by Mac OS X.

## Building

If you only modify the Java code, it's sufficient to invoke Maven

```
mvn clean package
```

This will create a `packr-VERSION.jar` file in `target` which you can invoke as described in the Usage section above.

If you want to compile the exe files used by packr, install premake, Visual Studio 2010 Express on Windows, Xcode on Mac OS X and GCC on Linux, then invoke the build-xxx scripts in the `natives/` folder. Each script will create an executable file for the specific platform and place it under src/main/resources.

## Limitations

  * Windows is 32-bit only, Mac OS X is 64-bit only
  * JRE minimization is very conservative, depending on your app, you can carve out stuff from a JRE yourself, disable minimization and pass your custom JRE to packr
 
## Code Warning

You may find some style issues with this code, namely:

  * lack of proper logging
  * lack of return value checking

This was conceived over a "weekend" so to speak, so please excuse any shortcomings. Happy to receive PRs!

## Security

Distributing a bundled JVM has security implications, just like bundling any other runtimes like Mono, Air, etc. Make sure you understand the implications before deciding to use this tool.
